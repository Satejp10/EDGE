# EDGE — browser recreation

A faithful, browser-playable recreation of the 2008 puzzle-platformer **EDGE**
(Two Tribes / Mobigame). Roll a cube across isometric tile levels, collect prisms,
reach the goal. Zero install — it runs in any modern browser.

This is a personal nostalgia / craft project, not a commercial product.

## Status

**Playable on desktop (keyboard) and mobile (touch).** The game lives in ES modules
under [`src/`](src/), built with Vite and deployed to GitHub Pages. The original
single-file prototype is kept as [`edge.html`](edge.html) for reference.

Next planned phase: static/dynamic render split and more levels. See
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the running log and [the roadmap](#roadmap) below.

## Play it now

No build required:

```
open edge.html in any modern browser   (double-click, or serve the folder and open it)
```

After the Vite migration this becomes:

```
npm install   →   npm run dev   →   open the localhost URL Vite prints
```

## Controls (desktop)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `W` `A` `S` `D` / arrow keys | Roll along the isometric diagonals |
| **hold** a direction | Keep rolling continuously |
| tap toward a ledge again | Commit the edge → fall; opposite tap → recover |
| `P` / `Esc` | Pause (freezes everything) |
| `R` | Restart |
| `T` | Tuning panel (climb speed, camera azimuth/elevation) |

The four moves land on screen **diagonals**: `↑`→up-right, `↓`→down-left,
`→`→down-right, `←`→up-left.

## Controls (mobile)

On coarse-pointer devices (or with `?touch` in the URL) an on-screen **D-pad** appears
bottom-left and round **⏸ / ⟳ / ⚙** system buttons bottom-right. The default
**diamond** pad points each arrow the way the cube actually moves on screen; a
**cross** layout is available via the toggle in the tuning panel (⚙), persisted in
`localStorage`. Hold an arrow to keep rolling; at a ledge, tap the same arrow again to
commit the fall — identical semantics to the keyboard, because the buttons feed the
same input path. Original mockup: [`controls-mockup.html`](controls-mockup.html).

## Architecture — and why

The single most important decision: **the renderer is hand-rolled Canvas 2D, not
WebGL / three.js.**

The first version used three.js + WebGL and **crashed** on machines that fell back to a
software WebGL context (lowp precision): `MeshStandardMaterial` failed to compile, and
three.js r128 then threw because the software driver returns `null` from
`gl.getParameter(gl.VERSION)`, which three calls string methods on without guarding.
Rather than keep patching three for a broken GL context, the whole renderer was rewritten
to plain Canvas 2D — **isometric projection + Rodrigues-rotation cube math + painter's-
algorithm depth sort**. Result: zero GPU dependency, can't hit those crashes, truly
offline single file.

> **Do not reintroduce WebGL / three.js casually.** Only on a confirmed
> hardware-accelerated context, and only if Canvas 2D genuinely can't keep up.

Other key choices:

- **Vanilla JS, no game engine.** The renderer is bespoke isometric math; Phaser (~500KB
  full framework) or Pixi (renderer-only) would sit unused or fight the hand-rolled
  pipeline.
- **Single HTML file (so far)** because it was the fastest way to prototype and is
  *already* a hostable static site. Graduating to **Vite + vanilla JS** right before the
  project grows (level editor, many levels).

### Core mechanics

- **Roll math:** flat roll = 90° pivot about the shared edge; ±1 step climb/descend =
  180° pivot. Steps ≥ +2 are walls (blocked); drops ≤ −2 are falls. Only ±1 is traversable.
- **Edging:** roll into a drop → the cube clings; re-tap the same direction = fall, opposite
  = recover. OS key-repeat is ignored so hold-to-roll can't fling you off a ledge.
- **Movers:** a global tick clock (BEAT ≈ 0.85s) drives moving platforms; they glide
  smoothly and carry a rider. Logical cell updates once per beat.
- **Fallers:** collapsing tiles cycle `solid → armed → falling → gone → rising → solid`,
  giving "keep moving" pressure with a retry.
- **Fall rule:** a dynamic `heightAt()` query (static cells + mover current cell + faller
  state) plus one rule — *no ground under the cube → fall* — handles vanished blocks and
  movers sliding away cleanly.

A fuller decision log and historical gotchas live in `HANDOFF_edge.md` (kept in-repo as
project context).

## Roadmap

1. ~~**Vite + vanilla-JS migration**~~ — DONE (v0.2.0).
2. ~~**Mobile touch controls**~~ — DONE: Cross + Diamond D-pads switchable via a settings
   toggle, feeding the same input path so hold-to-roll works for free. Auto-enabled on
   coarse-pointer devices; forced on any device with `?touch` in the URL (desktop testing).
3. ~~**Fixed-timestep loop + render interpolation**~~ — DONE: 120 Hz fixed sim +
   alpha-lerped rendering (`engine/loop.js`), first test suite via `npm test` (node:test).
4. **Static/dynamic render split** — cache the static floor; only redraw moving geometry.
5. ~~**JSON level loader + real levels**~~ — DONE: JSON data + `registry.js` loader,
   `loadLevel()`, next-level win flow (Phase 1); plus four original levels — Corner Climb,
   Ferry, Crumble Run, and the capstone **Topple** — auto-advancing 1→2→3→4→5→1 (Phase 2),
   with a "TOPPLE — an EDGE homage" card on clearing the last level.
6. **Polish & deploy** — object pooling, profiling, error telemetry; host on a free static host.

## Project layout

```
EDGE/
  index.html           # Vite entry (markup + CSS + early error overlay)
  vite.config.js       # base:'./' so the build runs from the Pages subpath
  package.json
  src/
    main.js            # bootstrap, wiring, main loop
    config.js          # timing constants + live-tunable settings

    render/            # canvas.js, camera.js, renderer.js
    game/              # world.js, cube.js, dirs.js, input.js
    levels/            # *.json level data + registry.js (active-level loader)
    ui.js              # HUD, overlays, tuning panel
    touch.js           # mobile D-pad + system buttons (coarse-pointer, or ?touch)
  .github/workflows/deploy.yml   # build + deploy to GitHub Pages
  edge.html            # original single-file prototype (reference)
  controls-mockup.html # mobile control layout mockup (now implemented in src/touch.js)
  README.md
  CHANGELOG.md         # running log of changes & progress
  HANDOFF_edge.md      # original project handoff / decision log (context)
```

## Constraints / non-goals

- Must run in a plain browser with no mandatory backend, and survive weak/software GPU
  contexts (hence Canvas 2D).
- No audio, no accounts/backend for the core demo, no heavy game engine.
- No WebGL/three.js reintroduction unless the software-context crash is provably gone.
